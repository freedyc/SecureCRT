Changes in SecureCRT 7.0 (Official) -- July 3, 2012
---------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - SSH1/SSH2: When a window decoration such as the chat window or
    button bar was toggled, or the Session or Global Options dialog
    was closed, IPv6 listening ports being used for tunneling were
    closed.
  - Windows: When the mouse hovered over the button bar field in the
    button bar, SecureCRT could crash.
  - Mac/Linux: If the tab status indicators were set to "Colored
    rectangles", SecureCRT crashed when trying to lock a tabbed
    session.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.0 (Beta 4) -- June 19, 2012
--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Windows: In the File menu, "Connect in Tab..." was changed to
    "Connect in Tab/Tile...".
  - Windows: In the Connect dialog, when in tiled mode, the "Open in a
    tab" option is called "Open in a tiled window".

    custom .MNU file was increased from 2000 to 8000.

Bug fixes:

  - If a script issued an "exit" command to an SFTP session, SecureCRT
    crashed.
  - If a script issued an "ls" command to an SFTP session, SecureCRT
    hung.
  - When multiple tabs were open, sometimes the leftmost tab was
    shifted over such that the status indicator icon was partially
    obscured.
  - When multiple tabs were open, if a tabbed session was closed, the
    tab to the left of the closed tab was activated instead of the
    tab to the right.
  - If the global option "Confirm when closing multiple tabbed or
    tiled sessions" was on and the global option "Show confirm
    disconnect dialog" was off, when a single tabbed session was
    connected and SecureCRT was closed, the confirm disconnect dialog
    was displayed.
  - Windows: If the tab status indicator style was set to "Background
    colors" and a session was disconnected while in tiled mode, the
    status indicator was incorrect after switching to tabbed mode.
  - Mac: When the Quick Connect dialog was displayed, the previous
    hostname was not highlighted.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.0 (Beta 3) -- June 5, 2012
-------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Windows: The "Window" menu was changed so that it always contains
    the following items: Tabs, Tile Vertically, Tile Horizontally,
    Cascade, and the list of open sessions.
  - Windows: If the sessions are tiled and a new session is opened,
    all the sessions are automatically re-tiled.

    no sessions were open.

    or mapped key and no sessions were open.

    data, the data pasted was not correct.
  - Windows: If a session had the "Scale the font" option set, when
    switching between tabbed and tiled sessions, that session's font
    could become extremely large.
  - Windows: The tab titles of cloned sessions did not contain the
    number indicator (e.g., "(1)", "(2)", etc.).

Changes:

  - Custom log data is no longer inserted into raw logs.
  - Mac/Linux: Added support for the "Display logon prompts in
    terminal window" option.

    /Library/Application Support/VanDyke/SecureCRT.

Bug fixes:

  - When the option "Scroll to clear screen" was off in a session, if
    the same session was opened again in another tab or cloned, the
    option was on in the new sessions.
  - SecureCRT did not log Korean characters correctly.
  - The lock icon was not displayed for locked sessions when the tab
    appearance was set to "Background colors".  The tab is now changed
    to gray when it's locked.

    application window was maximized and a session was opened in a tab
    and cloned, the cloned session was blank.

    the "Session Options" dialog was opened and closed, the tab title
    was changed to the session name.

    from the toolbar, SecureCRT would crash when attempting to display
    the "View" menu.
  - Windows: After sending a tiled session to a new window, switching
    to tabbed mode, and then dragging the session back to the original
    window, the session name was not displayed.

    password and the option "Display logon prompts in terminal window"
    was set, the session failed to connect instead of prompting for
    the correct password.

    not work correctly when one multi-byte character was entered
    immediately after another multi-byte character.
  - Mac/Linux: If multiple sessions were connected in tabs at the same
    time from the "Connect" dialog, the non-active tabs did not have a
    cursor in them when they activated.
  - Mac: SecureCRT was not compatible with window managers such Divvy
    and Deskovery.
  - Mac: Underscores were displayed as spaces in sessions that used
    the "Andale Mono" or "Courier New" fonts.

    connects.

    authenticating.

    button bar if the configured buttons did not fit in the window.
  - Added "Send Break" to the "Edit" menu, which sends a Telnet break.
  - If a change is made to the settings of a cloned session, the
    change is propagated to the other SecureCRT windows and/or
    sessions.
  - The first tabbed session's scrollbar settings are used for
    subsequent tabbed sessions so that all the sessions will have
    the same number of rows and columns.

    4 GB, an error is reported.

    opened.

    in the status bar.
  - Windows: When there are multiple tabbed sessions, only the
    active session is displayed in the Windows 7 task bar preview.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT crashed when a script was run that sent an exit
    command to an SFTP tab.
  - SecureCRT crashed if a script called GetOption("[SSH2] Port")
    on a session that did not specify a firewall.
  - If a command was typed at the prompt, but ENTER was not pressed,
    and then the session was scrolled back to the oldest row and the
    top row was selected and ENTER was pressed, SecureCRT could crash.

    was set, the lines of scrollback was set to 0, the visible rows

    be saved.

    size" enabled, but "Show chat window" disabled was connected, the
    number of rows in the session was not correct.
  - When a key was mapped to a function or arrow key that sent a
    multi-byte escape sequence, the mapped key sometimes didn't
    work.
  - The title bar setting in the "Default" session could be used to
    rename tabs using substitution parameters for "Quick Connect"
    sessions, but was not honored for saved sessions without a
    username.
  - The "Quick Connect" dialog sometimes used the default username or
    previously used username even though the username was empty.
  - The keyboard-interactive password prompt was displayed when the
    password was specified on the command line with the /PASSWORD flag.
  - If a log file contained a leading space, an error was reported.
  - The keyboard accelerator for "Clear Screen and Scrollback" did
    not work from a custom menu.
  - If there were two tabbed sessions and there was scrollback data
    in the second tab and then the second tab was disconnected and

    such as session name or username were also specified, the /Log
    parameter was not honored.

    popups was set, it was not possible to detect failures by looking
    at error codes in crt.GetLastError and crt.GetLastErrorMessage.
  - SSH1/SSH2: If key re-exchange occurred during a transfer and
    "zlib@openssh.com" compression was being used, the session
    disconnected.
  - SSH2: Authentication failed when the server requested the keyboard-
    interactive method more than once.
  - Windows: If the Windows Input Method Editor (IME) was being
    used to input Korean characters and data was received, the IME
    was cancelled, causing the wrong character to be inserted into
    the session.
  - Windows: When a session name was longer than 32 characters,
    it was listed twice in the Windows 7 Start menu and taskbar
    MRU list.
