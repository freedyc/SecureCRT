Product Overview
----------------

SecureCRT protects your passwords, user accounts, and data, combining
rock-solid terminal emulation with the strong encryption, broad
authentication options, and data integrity of the Secure Shell (SSH)
protocol.

SecureCRT provides versatile solutions for a wide range of business,
network management, information security, and development tasks, from
accessing host-based applications and administering servers to
securely accessing behind-the-firewall network resources like e-mail,
files, and printers.

SecureCRT supports SSH1, SSH2, Telnet, Telnet/SSL, RLogin, Serial,
and TAPI protocols and authentication via password, public key, X.509
certificate, and Kerberos v5 via GSSAPI.  Ciphers include AES,
Twofish, Blowfish, 3DES, and RC4.

Choose from a wide range of emulations including VT100, VT102, VT220,
ANSI, SCO ANSI, Wyse 50/60, Xterm, and Linux console -– all with ANSI
color.  Unicode support includes the ability to display character sets
from multiple languages, support for languages with right-to-left
reading order, and a character encoding list that includes
commonly-used encodings as well as all encodings supported by the
local system.

SecureCRT features a multi-session tabbed interface with extensive
session management and customization features.  Customization options
include toolbars, menus, keymaps, button bar, and login scripts, as
well as fonts, cursors, and color schemes. 

Named sessions and firewalls let you create individual configurations
that can be used on a session-specific basis.  Other features include
auto logon, printing, Emacs mode, and SOCKS firewall support.

Powerful scripting capabilities including ActiveX scripting support
for VBScript and other scripting languages on Windows, embedded
Python support, and the script recorder save you valuable time by 
automating routine configuration tasks.  Secure file transfers can be
performed using Zmodem or Xmodem from an SSH1 or SSH2 session.  Upload
files easily by dragging and dropping them onto an SFTP tab or session
window.

Save steps with the close integration of SecureCRT and the SecureFX(R)
file transfer client, which share sessions and settings that let you
run SFTP, FTP, SCP, and FTP/SSL file transfer sessions without
reentering passwords.

SecureCRT includes a 30-day try-before-you-buy evaluation license for
the fully functional application and access to VanDyke Software(R)
technical support.

1. New For SecureCRT 7.0
------------------------

SecureCRT 7.0 introduces tiled sessions for easy viewing of multiple
sessions. There's also a built-in TFTP server that provides an 
additional option for file transfer, and enhancements to authenti-
cation and mapped button and key options to help you keep your work 
flowing smoothly.

Here are some of the new features in SecureCRT 7.0:

Tiling

  - Tiled sessions make it easier to compare multiple sessions or
    view output when sending commands to all sessions via the chat
    window. Sessions can be tiled vertically, horizontally, or
    cascaded.

Built-in TFTP server

  - Lock the built-in server via IP address to the client router
    for increased security as compared to running a separate TFTP
    server. Automatically start the TFTP server when a session
    connects, use TFTP to deploy firmware upgrades on network
    equipment, and backup or revert configurations on network
    devices.

Improved "Connect" dialog performance

    When a configuration is stored on a network location or 
    contains a large number of sessions, the "Connect" dialog now
    loads significantly faster.

Authentication enhancements

  - Skip authentication methods (SSH2): Use the "Skip" button to skip
    authentication methods such as PublicKey or GSSAPI that might not
    be supported or configured on some systems. If a password has
    expired, you can still log on to the server using a different
    authentication method.

Mapped button and key enhancements

  - Button hover text: See what a button is mapped to without having
    to edit the button.

  - Mappable functions: Map "Always on Top" to a key and map items on
    the "Tools" menu to either a button or key.

Please see SecureCRT_History.txt in the SecureCRT program group for the
list of new features, changes, and bug fixes.
