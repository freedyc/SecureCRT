Changes in SecureFX 7.0 (Beta 1) -- May 3, 2012
-----------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Added a filter control that supports wildcards to the session
    toolbar, which makes it easier to find specific folders and files in
    local and remote sessions.
  - After a synchronize operation, the synchronize file list is
    automatically refreshed when changes are made to files on the local
    system, which allows files to be re-synchronized without having to
    close the synchronize tab.
  - A refresh button was added to the synchronize view, which allows
    files to be re-synchronized after the initial synchronization.
  - Bookmarks can be opened directly from the right-click menu in local
    and remote sessions and from the "File" menu.
  - Added a global option to position the local window at the bottom
    or right when SecureFX is tabbed horizontally or vertically.
  - SFXCL: Added the ability to specify explicit FTPS on the command
    line as "ftpes://".
  - SSH2: Added the ability to skip authentication methods while
    authenticating.

Changes:

  - Improved the performance of synchronization operations involving a
    large number of files.
  - SecureFX will continue connecting when either of the initial PBSZ
    or PROT commands fails, in compliance with Note 1 in section 12.1
    of RFC 4217.
  - In the Synchronize view, the information in the "Last Action" column
    for transfers was changed to specify whether the transfer was an
    upload or download.
  - The synchronize view columns were modified so that the current
    status and last action are shown.
  - It is no longer possible to add duplicate bookmarks.
  - The "Open Bookmarks" dialog was renamed "Manage Bookmarks".
  - FTPS: SecureFX now logs server-to-server file transfer failures.
  - SFXCL: Added a command-line option "/Chmod", which provides the
    ability to change permissions of remote files.
  - SFXCL: SFXCL returns the error code for file not found if a wildcard
    is specified and there are no matches.

Bug fixes:

  - After browsing to a folder with a large number of files (> 35,000)
    and then cancelling the listing, SecureFX could crash.
  - Synchronization operations that accessed UNC shares failed on
    Windows Server 2008 R2.
  - Double-clicking a local file resulted in an error if the file type
    was associated with an editor such as EmEditor.
  - It was not possible to navigate to a remote folder where the group
    name contained a space.
  - If values for "Remote ListView State" were garbage, it caused the
    columns in the "Details" view to be displayed incorrectly.
  - If a transfer that caused the choose transfer type and overwrite
    prompts to be displayed was started and the network disconnected
    while the first prompt was displayed and then the session
    reconnected, the second prompt was not displayed and the file was
    overwritten.
  - The "Quick Connect" dialog sometimes used the default username or
    previously used username even though the username was empty.
  - Double-clicking a bookmark in the "Open Bookmark" dialog did not
    open the bookmark.
  - The DELETE key could not be used to delete a bookmark in the "Open
    Bookmarks" dialog.
  - If more than one instance of SecureFX was running, changes made
    through the "View" menu were not propagated to the other instance(s).
  - SecureFX created a registry structure for configuration
    information when the configuration folder was specified on the
    command line using "/F".
  - FTP/FTPS: SecureFX file transfer operations stalled if a 526 error
    was received from the remote system.
  - FTP: While attempting to connect to an FTP server using an HTTP
    proxy and PASV data connections, if SecureFX was unable to obtain
    the peer address from the control connection, it crashed.
  - FTP: When an FTP session connected to 127.0.0.1, the machine's
    actual IP address was used for the PORT command instead of
    127.0.0.1.
  - SSH2: Authentication failed when the server requested the keyboard-
    interactive method more than once.
  - SFXCL: On servers that stored timestamps in seconds rather than
    milliseconds, when the "Overwrite older" flag was specified,
    identical files were uploaded again.
  - Windows: With tabs off, when a local or remote window was
    minimized and then selected from the Windows 7 task bar, the
    restored window was not painted correctly.
  - Windows: In the Chinese version of Windows XP and Vista, the font
    used for the title bar, menu, and status bar was smaller than the
    system font.
