Product Overview
----------------

SecureFX is a high-security file transfer client with flexible
configuration options and support for SFTP, FTP over SSL (TLS), FTP,
and SCP protocols.  SecureFX is easy-to-use with a tabbed main window
and an Explorer-like interface.  Advanced features include relentless
file transfers, remote editing, public-key and Kerberos v5 (GSSAPI)
authentication, and site synchronization.  When you connect to a site
that supports SSH2, SecureFX has everything you need to create a fully
encrypted SFTP session.

With SecureFX it’s easier than ever to perform secure file transfers.
Establish a secure connection with a mouse click, or type a server
name in the Connect bar, and then drag and drop files to and
from the server and your desktop, Windows Explorer, and other
applications.  Or perform fully automated, unattended file transfers
with the SFXCL command-line utility.  "Relentless" file transfers
automatically reconnect and resume transfers when connections are
broken.

SecureFX also provides synchronization between your local files and a
remote directory on a remote server. You can configure SecureFX to
upload updated files from the local directory to the remote directory,
download updated files from the remote to the local, or mirror
whichever site you choose (mirroring includes automatically deleting
files or folders that are not on the source directory from the
destination directory, allowing you to exactly match the destination
and source). You can also configure filters for synchronize operations
allowing you to control which files and folders are affected. To enable
one-click synchronization use the Quick Synchronize dialog to configure
your synchronization settings; then press a toolbar button to initiate
a synchronize operation using those settings. If you need to keep more
than one remote site synchronized, the Synchronize dialog lets you
create, save, and manage session synchronizations, and initiate
comparison operations.

With the tree-based session manager, arrange hundreds of sites any way
you like.  Named sessions allow you to save preferences for individual
sites.  Named firewalls can be used on a session-specific basis so
that you can work from multiple locations with different firewalls.  
SecureFX also provides support for IPv6 and the ability to run 
multiple instances of the application.

SecureFX supports AES, Twofish, Blowfish, 3DES, and RC4 ciphers.
Authentication methods include password, public-key, and X.509
(including self-signed certificate) authentication, as well as Kerberos
v5 authentication via GSSAPI.  RSA and DSA key formats are supported
for host keys and public keys.

If you need both terminal emulation and file transfer, SecureCRT(R)
and SecureFX are closely integrated, sharing sessions and settings so
that you can run SFTP, FTP, SCP, and FTP/SSL file transfer sessions
without reentering passwords.  Or for a complete file transfer
solution, combine SecureFX with VShell(R) server to provide fine-tuned
file transfer privileges on a user or group basis.

SecureFX includes a 30-day try-before-you-buy evaluation license for
the fully functional application and access to VanDyke Software(R)
technical support.

1. New for SecureFX 7.0
-----------------------

SecureFX 7.0 improves productivity with a toolbar filter with wildcard
support for quickly finding files and folders in local and remote
sessions. Also new are faster synchronization of large numbers of
files and the ability to re-synchronize files from the current
synchronization window, as well as SFXCL and interface enhancements.

Here are some of the new features in SecureFX 7.0:

Filter view

  - The new toolbar filter helps you quickly find files and folders in
    the current local and remote working directories.  Wildcards make 
    it easy to find the exact set of files you want to transfer.

Synchronization enhancements

  - Re-synchronize: The synchronize file list is automatically
    refreshed when changes are made to files on the local system and
    a Refresh button lets you re-synchronize without having to close
    the synchronize tab.

  - Improved synchronize speed: Synchronizing a large number of files
    is now faster.

SFXCL enhancements

  - Specify explicit FTPS: Specify explicit FTPS on the command line
    as ftpes//.

  - /Chmod option: Change permissions of remote files using the /Chmod
    command-line option.

Interface enhancements

  - Customize local window position: A new option lets you position the
    local window tab where you want it.

  - Quicker access to bookmarks: Conveniently open bookmarks directly
    from the right-click menu or File menu.
